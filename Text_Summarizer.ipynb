Are interested in one of the projects?\\nDiana: Great! Thanks for replying so quickly :)\\nDiana: I was browsing your website and looking for different opportunities. I am particularly interested in Asia and Northern America, my only problem is that I don't speak other language than English\\nChris: Ok, it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't be eligible to participate in projects in other countries. Especially in Asia we have a lot of opportunities for people who would like to teach English\\nDiana: That's great news! Won't it be a problem that I'm not a teacher? I don't have any experience\\nChris: It all depends on what you would like to do, are you interested in being a volunteer or in something paid?\\nDiana: I'm interested in travelling that's for sure, so I really want to go somewhere. If you have something that will allow me to get paid for my work and will be in line with my experience, that'd be absolutely wonderful.\\nDiana: I'm open for being a volunteer as well - the only problem's that I may not be able to afford to pay for the accommodation.\\nChris: Most of the organisations we're cooperating with cover the cost of the accommodation of our volunteers. You usually pay for a plane ticket and food. Certain organisations offer pocket money\\nDiana: Yes, I saw one really interesting offer from Japan. They're looking for someone who could teach English in high school, although they listed some nationalities - didn't mention British, quite surprising in my opinion. Does it mean that I can't apply?\\nChris: Could you please send me a link? We have a lot offers and it'd be easier for me to advice you if I know the offer\\nDiana: Sure <file_other>\\nChris: Thanks!\\nChris: Okay, so, I think in this case it shouldn’t be a problem. You may not be regarded as a preferred candidate, but I don’t think that you’re not eligible. Also, if you’re really interested, I’ll gladly contact the organisers and ask if they are interested in your profile.\\nDiana: That would be amazing! Thank you Chris!\\nChris: If this one doesn’t work out, and please, be aware that we’re in touch with people all over the world so it may happen that you won’t get the job you applied for, are you interested in another position?\\nDiana: I think I’ll be happy to participate in any project in Japan (as a volunteer or not), unless it’s related to computers, IT, technology, etc. as I have absolutely no clue about that stuff\\nChris: And what about North America? You mentioned that you may be interested in this as well\\nDiana: Yes, I think it’s pretty much the same as with Japan. I’m not too keen on being a teacher at a camp, but everything other than that would be great\\nChris: Got it! I will look for something suitable. May you send me your CV?\\nDiana: <file_other>\\nChris: Thanks! If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask :)\\nDiana: Thank you! I really appreciate your help Chris.

The users of the site would rate them for various aspects like clarity, production quality, lack of boredom, etc, and would answer other peoples questions on them.\\nAndy: So how would this make money?\\nJacqui: It would be an Amazon partner as far as the paid books are concerned, and as far as the other resources were concerned it would run ads, or offer a paid version with no ads.\\nAndy: What about the cost of all the labour in setting it up?\\nJacqui: I was thinking of using work-experience kids for that, from various University faculties. They could get it started and at critical mass we could throw it open to the public with options for them to content-create within the portal.\\nAndy: OK, well I can write the architecture for you, and that together with a hosting for the first year and the cost of getting the start of content is going to be something between two and three hundred dollars.\\nJacqui: OK, I'll see if I can get some crowdfunding going.

I’m thinking about buying a cross trainer. Does anyone of you have any experience in using it at home? Could you maybe recommend me something?\\nAnna: Hi John! I bought my first cross trainer a couple of years ago and I have been using one ever since. The type of the machine greatly depends on your built and how much many you would like to spend.\\nJohn: My budget is quite limited as is the space in my living room…\\nMichael: I’d advise you to first measure the room to know how big the machine can actually be for you to exercise comfortably and effectively.\\nTom: Waste of money, most expensive cloth hanger\\nJohn: Hahaha, I hope it won’t be in my case. I’m quite determined to lose some weight. I’m tall and a bit overweight, so I worry that I may break the machine\\nAnna: Don’t worry about that. It shouldn’t be a problem, but have a look at the specs just in case.\\nMichael: When it comes to the price, cheaper models don’t have as many electronic options as the more expensive do, but I’d advise you to invest in it if you’re being serious about losing weight.\\nJohn: Why’s that?\\nMichael: You can always exercise with your phone and an app, but it’s not the most comfortable way (tried it myself). It’s good to have at least three preinstalled programmes like weight-loss, interval, etc. Then the machine will think for you.\\nAnna: My first cross trainer didn’t have such options and I must admit that I was also training with my phone and keeping my times. Now, when the old broke, I bought a “fancier” model and I definitely don’t regret it\\nJohn: Do you have any company you can recommend? Or a specific model?\\nSusan: I have OBE8731 Powerstride 18\" Rear Drive and I think it’s ok.\\nAnna: I think that in case of cross trainer it really goes down to the price range. You won’t be able to buy a really good equipment cheaply.\\nMichael: I agree, especially if you’re determined and interested in your scores. It may sound silly, but I think tracking your progress helps to lose weight.\\nJohn: Thank you so much for your advice! I can’t spend too much, but I don’t want to throw my money away on something that won’t serve me…\\nAnna: Sure, again, in my opinion it is a thing worth investing in. Look up some tutorials and exercise plans in Google, it will also help you out to achieve your goal.\\nMichael: Good luck!', 'Chris: beer in the bar at 8?\\nPhil: deal\\nChris: see you\\nPhil: <file_gif>', \"Damian: Have a situation and need your help mate.

We even thought about charging people to ride around the garden in the summer.\\nRick: Well, I don't see why you shouldn't give it a go, after all the garden will look stunning when it's done.\\nEloise: I hope so!
